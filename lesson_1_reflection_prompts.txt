How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

 
	It is usefull to show typing errors.



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?


	It makes it easier to keep track of the process. And, in this case, you can compare the new documents to the old ones.



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
	Manually choosing gives more flexibility on creating commits and doesn´t overloads the computer with unecessary files. Saving automatically is more confortable though.



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


	Some files are interconnected (like xml and java for example) where one depends on the other. So, can be useful saving every file in one commit.



How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log show every commit that was registered on the project. git diff allows you to compare two pices of code and see the differences.



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?
	I wont be so afraid of doing changes because i know i can fix it later with git.



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	To edit my android code files and prepare myself to the next step in my studies.
